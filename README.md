# Customer Segmentation 

## Description:

This project implements customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to categorize customers based on their financial behavior. It begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, followed by data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and outliers. The data is then scaled and dimensionality reduction is performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, and K-Means clustering is applied to segment customers into distinct groups. Finally, the characteristics of each cluster are analyzed, and the results are saved in a CSV file for further use.

**Key Questions Solved:**
1. How can we categorize customers based on their financial attributes?
2. What are the distinct characteristics of each customer segment?
3. How can this segmentation be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction?
4. What are the main factors influencing customer behavior and engagement?

**Benefits:**
- **Improved Targeting:** By understanding different customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing campaigns and promotions to specific groups, resulting in higher engagement and conversion rates.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Customized products, services, and communication strategies can be developed to meet the unique needs and preferences of each segment, leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation:** By focusing resources on high-value segments, businesses can optimize their marketing budget and maximize return on investment.

**Conclusion:**

Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that enables businesses to gain valuable insights into their customer base and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. By effectively segmenting customers based on their financial behavior, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction, improve targeting accuracy, and drive sustainable growth. This project provides a practical demonstration of how machine learning techniques can be applied to achieve meaningful customer segmentation, with the potential to unlock significant value for businesses across various industries.
